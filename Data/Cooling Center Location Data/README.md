This notebook is an example of how to collect cooling center locations in a given region. 
This particular code is for Austin, TX but can be adapted for any city. 

For our investigation, we search OpenStreetMap for the tags "library", "community center", "senior", and "recreation center." This creates our dataset of cooling centers (witnesses) used in our paper.
